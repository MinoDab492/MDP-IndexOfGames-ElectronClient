## Contributing

The Index Of Games is a great, fun, and safe way to play games, and that's how I want it to be. What started initially as a project for me and my friends to play games on *those* days at school, has evolved in to a page that many used, and now, a local Desktop Client built on the Electron Framework.
Contribution from the community is a great way to keep everything working, from improving existing games, adding new games, and improving the code that allows it to run through Electron. However, there are some guidelines to follow when contributing, to help keep everything organized, and safe.

## How To Contribute

So you've made a change, or added a new game. Fantastic! But, how do you upload it? First, it will be different based on what you did. Changes to the Electron client should be applied to the appropriate files, and a file named changelog.txt should be added to the root, detailing what changes have been made.
When adding a new game, create a new folder in the root directory, named 'Games', then put your new code in there, along with the name of the game. Games will be uploaded on your behalf (with credit) to the Index Of Games page.

## How To Submit Changes

The change is done, and you've formatted everything correctly, but, how do you submit the change? That's where pull requests come in to play. Once your changes have been set up, and all the formatting has been set up, simply open a pull request to this repository, as that is how code changes will be pulled in. Please note that pull requests without a description, or name to detail what it is will be auto denied generally, with limited exceptions.
