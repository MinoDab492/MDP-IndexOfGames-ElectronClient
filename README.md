##  MDP-IndexOfGames-ElectronClient

## About This Project
The Index Of Games is a project made by me, initially for some school friends. The goal was to give us some entertainment on those boring days in school. Since then it has evolved to contain multiple games, a reimplementation of DOOM, Cookie Clicker, and some others.

## How To Contribute
Contributing is pretty simple. Simply clone this repository, and then set up a Node.JS/Electron development environment, and you're all good to go! (Worth note, currently, the website itself isn't open source, however, the Electron client uses URLLoad to launch it.)

## How To Compile
Compilation is currently configured and supported for two platforms, Windows, as a native .exe, or Linux, as a .deb file.
To compile for Windows, simply run the compileWin.bat file.
To compile for Linux, it's a little more involved. It requires installation of Docker For Windows. Utilizing ElectronUserLand/builder through Docker. More documentation will be written for compilation shortly.
