## Pull Request Template

If you're trying to open a pull request, then there are some things that you need to do, to ensure it's at it's best. This will help speed up approval time, and in some cases, your pull request may be automatically declined if missing some of these.

## Title

The title must contain a short description of what it does, this can be general. An example would be 'Adds a game'. If it's in reference to a specific issue open on GitHub, make sure to reference the issue number.

## Description

Please ensure the description contains a more detailed description of what your pull request does. For example, instead of 'Adds a game', you might say 'Adds [game_name] for integration in the index'. This would also include mentioning issue numbers if you fix an issue already on GitHub.
